          Thrift It is an app concept that helps people find new thrift shops,
          and assists with tracking their favourite collection drops. Thrift It
          can help make thrifting easier and more accessible for people.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          The appâ€™s initiative aims to promote thrifting as a sustainable
          alternative, addressing the environmental impact of consumerism on
          landfills and its significant contribution to climate change.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thrift It is a self initiated passion project that started off during
          my summer break. The emphasis on a clean and intuitive interface
          within the app reflects the simplicity inherent in the thrifting
          process, making it easy for users to navigate and engage with the app.

            <p>
              Thrifting is a sustainable concept focused on maximizing the
              lifespan of products, such as clothing items, before they are
              discarded into landfills.{" "}
            </p>
            <p>
              By giving these items a second life through resale, donation, or
              repurposing, thrifting helps reduce waste and promotes
              environmental conservation.

              <p className="text-xs text-primaryGreen sm:text-base lg:text-xl">
                The concept behind Thrift It was to consolidate all thrift
                stores onto a single platform, while promoting thrift shopping
                among users. While social media platforms like Instagram and
                Facebook have played a role in promoting small businesses and
                thrift stores, they come with certain drawbacks:
              </p>
              <ul className="list-disc pl-4">
                <li className="pl-2 pt-4">
                  <p className=" text-xs text-primaryGreen sm:text-base lg:text-xl">
                    Both Instagram and Facebook rely on ads and follower counts,
                    where a higher follower count implies greater credibility
                    for a page. Thrift It takes the review approach, allowing
                    products to be compared based on customer reviews for a
                    specific brand or business, placing emphasis on reviews as a
                    source of credibility.
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li className="pl-2 pt-4">
                  <p className=" text-xs text-primaryGreen sm:text-base lg:text-xl">
                    Social media platforms typically display one page at a time,
                    requiring users to use tags or type out business names to
                    switch between pages, or search for a particular product,
                    limiting the ability to compare multiple products
                    simultaneously. Thrift It addresses this limitation by
                    providing users the ability to view and compare all products
                    at once, similar to the experience on traditional e-commerce
                    platforms.
                  </p>
                </li>

                  <p className=" text-xs text-primaryGreen sm:text-base lg:text-xl">
                    In addition, the challenge of tracking thrifted items is
                    addressed through Thrift It's calendar feature. Thrifting
                    often involves keeping tabs on various drops and events,
                    which can be a hassle. The calendar feature aims to simplify
                    this process, ensuring users stay up-to-date with the latest
                    releases and events within the thrift community.

                <li className="pl-2 pt-4">
                  <p className=" text-xs text-primaryGreen sm:text-base lg:text-xl">
                    Furthermore, adding analytics such as carbon footprint can
                    enhance the app's usefulness and provide valuable insights,
                    particularly in today's fast fashion generation. Thrift It
                    aims to encourage users to be more mindful of the planet's
                    health, given the abundance of clothing already available
                    for the next decade. Thus, Thrift It can serve as the
                    platform to promote sustainability and responsible
                    consumption practices

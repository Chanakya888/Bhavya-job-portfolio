            Pincode is a simple way to find and share places online. It is a
            community-driven platform, where people get to share their favorite
            spots, eateries, hangouts, must-do activities or just a list of
            places (or pin codes as we call it) on the public digital forum. To
            us Pincode is more than just a list; it could be a collective memory
            of places, or a shared narrative curated by those who resonate with
            the essence of the place.
          </p>
          <p className="text-base lg:pt-6 lg:text-xl">
            Pincode adds the layer of personal touch. It is fueled by the
            passion and insights of the locals. People who have been living in
            your visiting cities for years together sharing what their idea of
            the place is like. Each pincode creator has the opportunity to add a
            personal note. These notes can be more than practical tips or
            recommendations; they could be stories, anecdotes, nuances or
            idiosyncrasies that add to the flavor of the place.
